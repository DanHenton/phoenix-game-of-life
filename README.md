# GameOfLife
Welcome to basic implementation of Conway's game of life in phoenix!
[Conway's Game of Life Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

I have used this as an opportunity to learn elixir and phoenix!

## Getting started

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Postgres is used for the database so one will need to be configured.

I have a simple docker-compose file for developers to get postgresql and PG admin installed here:
